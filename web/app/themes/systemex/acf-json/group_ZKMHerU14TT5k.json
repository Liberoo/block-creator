```json
{
  "key": "group_ZKMHerU14TT5k",
  "title": "[block] fds",
  "fields": [
    {
      "key": "field_abc123456789a",
      "label": "Decoration",
      "name": "decoration",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "key": "field_xyz123456789b",
      "label": "Kamil",
      "name": "kamil",
      "type": "clone",
      "clone": [
        "field_color_key_1",
        "field_color_key_2"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this JSON structure, the "text:decoration" field is represented as a text field with a unique key and a label/name formatted accordingly. The "clone:kamil(text:color)" field is represented as a clone field with the label "Kamil", name "kamil", and includes an array with placeholder keys for fields that match the type "text" and name "color". You'll need to replace `"field_color_key_1"` and `"field_color_key_2"` with the actual keys of the fields if available. If none of the actual fields match the criteria specified in the "clone" requirement, the clone array would be left empty.
